h1. Configuration

The first time you start email2smd it will create the following directory:

bc. ENV["HOME"]/.email2sms

Which basically means that it will create the hidden directory email2sms in your home directory (~/).

In addition to this it will create a configuration file template:

Open the config file and adapt it to your needs.

h1. Usage

The basic usage of email2sms is straight forward. It's mainly about starting and stopping the daemon.
Type

bc. email2smsd -h

to get more information. This help is generated by the daemon gem so this message is not application specific but it will give you to get a short introduction about how to control the daemon.

h2. Start

bc. email2smd start

h2. Stop

bc. email2smsd stop

Watch output in

bc. email2sms_main.rb.output

and

bc.  email2sms_main.rb.log

for detailed application state information and errors.

The files are located in the folder you have configured in your configuration file.
By default this is the directory from where you have started the daemon.

h2. Send e-mail

**Ok, now you are ready:**

In order to send an sms just send an email to the email adress configured in the email2sms.yml file.
If you use the subject filter then you will need to have the password in your subject line:

Message body:
Whatever

**That's it. Have fun!**
